# UW AHSLAB Hearing Test

A browser-based hearing test from the University of Washington Auditory Human
Systems Laboratory (AHSLAB). The test plays tones at several frequencies,
records trial-by-trial Yes/No responses, and estimates thresholds and PTA4
using a PCA-informed psychometric model.

## Run locally

This is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project; it has no build step or
package installation. From the project root, start a local web server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in a browser and select **Start**. Allow audio
playback, use headphones in a quiet environment, and follow the on-screen
instructions. The test asks for age and sex, then guides the participant
through the hearing test and displays results.

## PCA + psychometric model

The PCA mean and three-component loading matrix in [`js/pca.js`](js/pca.js)
were trained using a large NHANES database. They provide population-informed
bases for predicting the four-frequency threshold profile in each ear.
Rather than fitting those bases to the test's threshold-crossing summaries,
the application fits them to the original trial-by-trial stimuli and Yes/No
responses.

[`runPCA`](js/pca.js) reads the trial log, age, sex, and test mode from
`sessionStorage`. For each candidate set of three latent PCA scores, it
reconstructs the full 10-variable profile: age, sex, four right-ear
thresholds, and four left-ear thresholds. A logistic psychometric function
converts a reconstructed threshold and stimulus level into the probability of
a Yes response:

```text
P(Yes) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(level - threshold) / 5 dB))
```

The posterior over PCA scores is updated from all retained responses using
independent unit-normal score priors, shifted by the participant's age and sex
projected through the corresponding trained PCA loadings. In both-ears mode, a
Yes response is modeled as hearing the tone in either ear:
`P(Yes) = 1 - (1 - Pleft)(1 - Pright)`.

Before the final fit, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) predicts each
trial from the other trials. If the probability of the observed response is
below 5%, that response is excluded from the final posterior fit. If no trial
passes the cutoff, the reported profile is based on the age/sex-informed PCA
prior alone and the results page states that no responses were used. The
original stimuli and responses are not changed or deleted; the CSV export
includes the complete raw trial log and per-trial LOOCV probabilities/
exclusion flags. Posterior expectations are computed numerically over a grid
of candidate PCA scores.

The results page reports the reconstructed thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and
4000 Hz, plus each ear's PTA4 (the arithmetic mean of those four thresholds).
This is a population-informed denoising estimate, not a direct equipment
calibration or a guarantee of improved accuracy. Systematic errors that align
with learned population patterns may remain, and genuine atypical profiles
may also be smoothed.

## Project layout

- `index.html` — welcome page and starting point.
- `pages/` — survey, instructions, test, results, and follow-up pages.
- `js/playAudio.js` — tone playback, response collection, and raw thresholds.
- `js/pca.js` — trained PCA parameters and reconstruction functions.
- `js/results.js` — result display and CSV export.
- `css/style.css` — page styling.
- `images/` — logos and visual assets.

The application keeps answers and test results in browser `sessionStorage`.
They are used to move data between pages during a session and are cleared when
the session ends or the browser clears site data.
